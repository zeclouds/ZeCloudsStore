## Combined Demo Site

This Maven module is intended to represent a combined configuration that blends the admin and e-commerce site into a single
application. This is useful for smaller sites whose load demands do not require load balanced environment with multiple
instances of the site running. By combining the site and admin together, the overall resource requirements for the container
running both the applications are cut in half.
